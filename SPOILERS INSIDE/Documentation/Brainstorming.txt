WHITESPACE
- The core concept of the game is that the player initially only knows 3 buttons: LEFT, RIGHT, and FORWARD
- The player wanders aimlessly through these rooms until stuff happens and they have to figure stuff out. 
- The game should go past "just find the exit." I want underlying layers to the game.

What the player doesn't know
(SPOILERS)
Moving left and right record bits. Moving forward submits the bits to parse as a character using a predefined map. Forming enough characters results in a word, which interacts within the environment / system.

For example: "EXIT" and other synonyms are how the player actually "leaves" the maze. Specifically, the user can find a way out by following the path:
```
LLLLFLRRLFLRLRF (15 steps)
0000 0110 0101
   O    U    T
```
Using this keyword, the player would travel through 15 rooms to find the exit. 

Other ideas:
"OFF" - the next room's lights are off. This room requires a flashlight to get information
"FLASH" or "LIGHT" = the next room has a flashlight
"UV" turns on a UV view, which can provide more information. 
"FEAR" / "DEATH" / "BLOOD" and other synonyms for horror elements would significantly increase tension through audio, visuals, and possibly jumpscare.
"WHITESPACE" - if the user types WHITESPACE the game "fake" crashes and the player enters a whole new game. 
"HELP", "HINT", "HUH", "INFO", and synonyms will provide specific hints to the player.
"PHONE", "CALL", "RING" causes the next room to have a phone which the user can interact with to make a phone call. 
"MUSIC" and synonyms causes the next room to spawn with musical instrument which are hints to a puzzle
====================

Subtle hints will be conveyed to the player throughout the game. 

Symbols have different purposes which are aligned throughout gameplay. I'm not going to describe them in notepad.
(Left.png) NO, NULL, ZERO, or LEFT
(Right.png) YES, EXISTS, ONE, or RIGHT
(Submit.png) UNCERTAIN, TEST, CHECK, or SUBMIT

In the first room, the player will see the buttons to press in order to move (WAD or UP,LEFT,RIGHT).

These symbols will exist throughout the game, I guess?
I am at a writers block.
